//! Abstractions for providing connections to Servers and Clients, with the following purposes:
//!   * Allows both incoming connections and upgraded connections (previously originated
//!     in other protocols, such as WebSockets) to be provided -- enabling the "Protocol Stack Composition"
//!     pattern.\
//!     See [ServerConnectionHandler] and the lower level [ConnectionChannel].
//!   * Enables the pattern also for clients -- active connections may either be made or an existing one
//!     may be reused.\
//!     See [ClientConnectionManager]
//!   * Abstracts out the TCP/IP intricacies for establishing (and retrying) connections.
//!
//! IMPLEMENTATION NOTE: this code may be improved when Rust allows "async fn in traits": a common trait
//!                      may be implemented.
