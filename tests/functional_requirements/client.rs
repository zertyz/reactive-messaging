/// Multi-protocol clients -- those adhering to the "Composite Protocol Stacking" design pattern, were implemented in a way in which
/// the logic processors may "believe" that connections that are "arriving" may mean a "fresh connection" and, conversely, connections
/// that are "leaving" (possibly due to an upgrade to another logic processor) may mean a "closed connection".
///
/// Obviously, neither is necessarily true, and having a fine control over the connections is necessary for user code to be able to
/// correctly maintain "sessions": failure to register a new session (upon a new connection) may break the logic; on the other hand,
/// failure to remove a session (upon disconnection) may lead to resource exhaustion and memory leaks.
///
/// With a carefully designed "logic processor", "protocol event handler" and "routing function", it is indeed possible to detect --
/// from the logic processor's point of view -- that a connection is really new (instead of an upgraded one). Unfortunately, detecting
/// the opposite case (when the connection is "leaving") is not so easy: was the connection upgraded to another logic processor, as
/// part of one of the possible branches of the protocol? Or the other end disconnected?
///
/// With the sole purpose to make it easier (for user code) to handle sessions, the Multi-protocol use case of the [CompositeSocketClient]
/// introduces a second event kind, not seen in the Single-protocol use case: the [ConnectionEvent] -- which comes in addition to the
/// [ProtocolEvent], shared among both use cases.
///
/// The setup for the test of this requirement is:
///   * A server that, when receives a number `i`, answers with `i+1`. The server may be configured to disconnect when receiving a particular `i`;
///   * Start a "Composite Protocol Stacking" client with `n` number of states/protocols, starting from 0. Each protocol logic is
///     simple: upgrades the state to whatever number the server says when we send our `id`, being the last id reserved for a "graceful
///     disconnection" **made by the client logic**.
///
/// The proof of completeness of this requirement is, therefore:
///   a) Graceful disconnections by the local party (the client): For `n` in `1..10`, with the server configured to never close the connection,
///     1) assert that the connection event happened once, before the first protocol processor realizes that a connection is arriving;
///     2) assert that every protocol processor was informed that a connection has arrived;
///     3) assert that the last protocol processor receives the event that the connection is leaving -- and no other;
///     4) assert that the disconnection event happens after the protocol's "connection is leaving" event.
///   b) Forceful disconnections by the remote party (the server): For `n` in `1..10`, with the server configured to close the connection at `n`,
///     1) idem
///     2) idem
///     3) idem -- but notice the client's logic should not disconnect
///     4) idem -- ibidem.
